NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of January 1, 2025, by and between Alpha Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Disclosing Party"), and Beta Solutions Ltd., a California limited liability company ("Receiving Party").

1. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Confidential Information means any and all technical and non-technical information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, including but not limited to trade secrets, proprietary data, source code, algorithms, business plans, customer lists, financial data, and any other information designated as confidential.

2. OBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVING PARTY
The Receiving Party agrees to hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.

3. INDEMNIFICATION
The Receiving Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Disclosing Party and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and successors from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.

4. LIABILITY AND LIMITATION OF DAMAGES
In no event shall either party be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business, or loss of data, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The total cumulative liability of either party shall not exceed the fees paid under this Agreement in the twelve months preceding the claim.

5. TERMINATION
This Agreement shall commence on the date first written above and shall continue for a period of three (3) years unless earlier terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon termination, the Receiving Party shall immediately return or destroy all Confidential Information and provide written certification of such destruction.

6. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
The Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and therefore the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security.

7. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENT
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and representations. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

9. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

10. FORCE MAJEURE
Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement to the extent caused by circumstances beyond such party's reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, government actions, labor disputes, or failures of third-party service providers.
